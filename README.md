# SynchronizedMediaPlayer

A media player written in Java that requires the libvlcj api that can synchronize without the need for streaming or any connection to the Internet at all. It is able to pause and seek to any minute marker on the media of choice and then play within a millisecond of the next time your system clock changes minutes. This allows you to watch synchronized movies with friends with millisecond precision.
